# Shannon Fano Algorithm Implemenation: Using React
The Shannon-Fano algorithm is a technique used for data compression, specifically for lossless compression. It was developed by Claude Shannon and Robert Fano in the 1940s. The algorithm aims to reduce the size of data by assigning variable-length codes to different symbols based on their probabilities of occurrence.
